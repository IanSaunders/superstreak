## Welcome to Super Streak

# What is a Super streak?
* Runs must be no less than 5 km in distance
* Run must be carried out on consecutive calendar day
* At least one 5 km segment of the run must take less than 45 min
* Runs must be continuous, i.e. the 45 mins can’t be split over the course of the day
* The calendar day is the time zone of the location run
* Any streak less than 365 days is classed as a super streak attempt, anything less is an attempt

If so desired, you can submit your streak to: https://goo.gl/forms/4S7xxL7rcNIgOqln2

### Where can I see a list of streaks?

### Why 45 mins?

According to google the average person can walk 5 km in 45 mins. This is supposed to be a run!

###  What if I run over midnight?

You may have 1 long continuous run that starts and ends on different days. This may count for two days if there is 5 km section under 45 mins in each calendar day.

###  Help, I’m running 100 miles!

For runs longer than or equal to 50 miles, the time limit for running your 5 km may be increased to 70 mins.

###  I am flying and will be in the air for a day

If, and only if your flight arrives +2 days, i.e you take off on Friday and land Sunday, you may double the distance and time of your run either side of the flight to make up for the day in-the-air. Ie 10 km on the Friday or Sunday under 90 mins.

Why not force you to find a way to get the 5 km in, for example on the plane or in the airport. We already tried to keep a steak going in this situation, it very tricky as there are many things out of your control. For example delayed flights or having bags. Though we would prefer to be purist, this seemed like an acceptable compromise.

###  Can I run further and skip a day?

No

### Can I have 1 day off?

No

###  What proof do I need?

We are following a scouts honour approach.  That said, we will be adding an automated way to indicate current streaks are still live based on strava IDs and runs... so that’s a good start? If you are going 

###  How do we know a streak is live?

We ask for Strava IDs of streaks and use our magic internet worms to check every week on peoples updates. If you don’t use strava we email once a month to ask what’s happening!

###  I’m already streaking!

Good work! If you are already streaking we can add you in. There are just a couple of things to note.

We will only includes from the 26th March 2018 onwards.

Ideally some mild amount of proof would be useful

The above rules still apply.

###  I missed a day.

Take a day off. Have a tasty snack, and start again!
